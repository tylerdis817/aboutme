# CIS 4004 — Project 1: Resume Website (HTML + CSS)

This repo contains a semantic, accessible, responsive resume website ready for GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1. Replace placeholder content in `index.html`, `project-1.html`, `project-2.html`.
2. Put your **headshot** at `assets/headshot.jpg` (square crop recommended).
3. (Optional) Add a PDF copy of your resume at `assets/YourName_Resume.pdf` and update the link text.
4. Replace project images at `assets/project1.jpg` and `assets/project2.jpg`.
5. Update email and LinkedIn link in the header.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo named `yourusername.github.io` (replace with your GitHub username).
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo root and commit.
3. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io` after a minute. If needed, in **Settings → Pages**, ensure the
   **Branch** is `main` and the folder is `/ (root)`.

## Validate (Grading 40%: structure/accessibility/styling)
- Validate HTML: https://validator.w3.org/
- Check accessibility with WAVE: https://wave.webaim.org/
- No frameworks are used. Code uses semantic landmarks, skip link, and reduced motion support.

## Submit
- Paste your live URL into WebCourses.
- Export a `.zip` of the entire site folder for submission as well.
